## Description
Bull Queue is a very simple-to-use message queue system that leverages Redis to store the queue, and facilitates the communication between multiple microservices that share the same Redis instance. So I create this simple demo to showcase the usage of Bull Queue.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
